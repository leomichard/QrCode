This project is a reward system based on QR codes designed for automotive workshops using Quartz and then after Elf products.
This project description is for the moment only focused on the Quartz Website

The goal of the system is simple:
 Scanning a QR code on a product allows a workshop to earn points, which can later unlock promotions and rewards.

The platform is built to be secure, fair, and easy to use, while preventing fraud or misuse.


General Workflow
      1.    QR codes are created in advance by an administrator.
      2.    These QR codes are physically attached to products.
      3.    When a product is used in a workshop, a mechanic scans the QR code.
      4.    The scan gives points to the workshop.
      5.    Points accumulate at the workshop level.
      6.    When enough points are reached, promotions are unlocked.

At no point can QR codes be created or modified from the website.


QR Code Generation Logic (Admin Side)

QR codes are generated outside of the website, using a dedicated tool (currently a Python script later then, a small application).

How QR codes are generated

The administrator uses a simple text file where each line represents one product, for example:

216914 QUARTZ-INEO 10

Each line contains:
      •     A product number
      •     A product name
      •     A number of points associated with that product

The generation tool then:
      1.    Reads the file line by line
      2.    Creates a unique QR code for each product
      3.    Assigns the correct number of points to each QR code
      4.    Stores the QR code securely in the system
      5.    Generates a QR image that can be printed and attached to the product

Each QR code is unique and can only be used once.

The goal of the script (future app) is to become a small internal application used by administrators.

One of the objectives is to have all the data visible from a webpage.

QR Code Scanning Logic (Workshop Side)

When a mechanic scans a QR code:
      1.    The system checks if the QR code is valid
      2.    It verifies that the QR code has never been used before
      3.    If valid:
      •     The QR code is immediately locked
      •     The points are added
      •     The scan is recorded
      4.    If the QR code was already scanned:
      •     The scan is rejected
      •     No points are added

This guarantees that each QR code can only be used one time, even if someone tries to scan it again.

Points Logic
      •     Each QR code gives a specific number of points
      •     Different products can give different point values
      •     Points are earned by mechanics, but they belong to the workshop

Visibility rules
      •     A mechanic can only see:
      •     Their own scans
      •     The points they personally earned

      •     A workshop owner can see:
      •     Total workshop points
      •     Total scans
      •     A detailed breakdown of points earned by each mechanic

Points are never shared between workshops.

Promotions Logic
      •     Promotions are visible to everyone, even without logging in
      •     Each promotion has a minimum number of required points
      •     Promotions unlock based on the total points of the workshop and the workshop owner decides on which promotion spend their points

      •     Promotions are managed by administrators


Roles And Responsibilities

Administrator
      •     Generates QR codes offline
      •     Controls the reward system
      •     Has access to global statistics
      •     Manages promotions

Workshop Owner
      •     Manages one workshop
      •     Monitors workshop performance
      •     Sees total points and employee contributions
      •     Uses workshop points to unlock promotions

Mechanic
      •     Scans QR codes
      •     Earns points for the workshop
      •     Sees only personal performance

Key Principles Of The System
      •     QR codes are created only once, outside the website
      •     QR codes are single-use only
      •     Points are transparent and traceable
      •     Workshops are fully isolated from each other
      •     Promotions reward collective workshop performance

Summary

This system creates a clear and controlled reward mechanism where:
      •     Products generate value through QR codes
      •     Workshops are rewarded for activity and engagement
      •     Employees contribute without competing unfairly
      •     Administrators keep full control over QR generation
      •     The website remains simple, secure, and focused on usage


-Right now, the website is under deployed with my github two problems comes out of this:
The name leomichard.io/QrCode is not professional
The website depends of me
The solutions are: 
To change the url name to something professional. But we need to find a name for the project and to the URL. => Buying a domain name costs money

We need to find a host for the website. => It also costs money
The databases are under my Account of an app named Supabase. There is two options: 
Stay on Supabase and pay for the premium account on a TotalEnergies account
Change completely of host.

And, there is also a last problem, 
The email verification, phone verification cost money to create. (They can be easily done under supabase)
The Line verification for the website doesn't cost anything normally (TBC). But it takes a LOT of time. Primarily because we need to wait for a manual verification by the line team.
