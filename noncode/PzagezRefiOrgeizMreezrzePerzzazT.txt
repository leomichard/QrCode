  The typographies have been designed for digital use.



   The Nunito typography is mainly used for section titles,
   and for some key values or figures when they are visual.


   Roboto typography is used throughout the interface, except in the cases mentioned above.

The use of titles in capital letters is to be avoided: write titles in lower case
                                 .

                                 Red #ED0000 and dark grey #374649 are used mainly
                                 for text. Red is reserved for links and action elements in
                                 the application.


                                 Dark grey is mainly reserved for all text in the interface.

                                 Both colors are accessible at the AA level when used on
                                 white or light grey and grey backgrounds.


                                 White can only be used on text when contrast allows. It is
                                 otherwise reserved for the background.


                                 The W3C-WCAG accessibility standard recommends two
                                 contrast ratios:


                                 3:1 = for texts or flat areas whose surface is large enough
                                 to be easily readable.

                                 4.5:1 = for text or solid areas whose surface area is
                                 smaller and whose legibility becomes more difficult.
                                 Main colors Secondary colors
                                 These two colors are used mainly for interface elements.

                                 Solid colors are only used as cell backgrounds with text
                                 or symbols in the foreground.



                                 Their use should remain marginal and is intended to bring
                                 rhythm and variation to the whole interface. They are also
                                 used to emphasise certain areas of the screen by contrast,
                                 following the principles of information hierarchy.


                                 Grey and white solids should be used as a rule.



                                  Warning, the red links (ED0000) are not accessible on
                                 a background non-white.


                                 By default, all flat colors can be used, with the aim of
                                 promoting the brand's new multicolor and multi-energy
                                 positioning.
